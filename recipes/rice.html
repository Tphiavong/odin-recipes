    <p>There are many different variations of rice. Today I will teach you how to make steamed white rice. Fun fact: Rice can be further catergorized 
        as short or long grain.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>s
        <li>White rice short or long</li>
        <li>Measuring cup</li>
        <li>Rice cooker or a pot with a lid</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li><strong>If cooking rice with a pot a towel that could cover the top of the pot is helpful!</strong></li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Step-by-step (Rice Cooker)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure out your cup/s of rice.</li>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cool or cold water up to three times.</li>
        <li>Measure out cool/cold water to the same ratio as the amount of rice you measured.</li>
        <li>Hit the cook button and wait.</li>
        <li>Once it finishes cooking, let the rice set for fifteen more minutes before stiring the rice through. This helps
            prevent the rice that's on the bottom not stick and burn.
        </li>
